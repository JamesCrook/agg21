This example demonstrates the use of the FreeType font rendering 
engine (http://freetype.org). Please get file "timesi.ttf" before 
running this example. You can download it from:
http://www.antigrain.com/timesi.zip

Note that the building environment expects FreeType installed to
its standard place, that is, /usr/local/
